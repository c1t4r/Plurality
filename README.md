# Plurality

## Tool box for HPC container based on singularity.

This tool box consists of individual scripts which allow creation, modification and archival of software containers.
The HPC containers can be used on the HPC site bwForCluster JUSTUS. 

Planned features:

* tools should work mostly in user space
* should be easily adaptable to other similar bwHPC sites
* uses bwCloud service
